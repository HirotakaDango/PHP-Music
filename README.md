## Requirements

## How to Activate SQLite in XAMPP/LAMPP

If you are using **XAMPP** or **LAMPP** and encounter issues with SQLite:

### For XAMPP (Windows/macOS)

1. Open your `php.ini` file (usually found in `xampp/php/php.ini`).
2. Ensure these lines are **not** commented (remove the leading semicolon `;` if present):

    ```
    extension=pdo_sqlite
    extension=sqlite3
    ```

3. Save and restart Apache using the XAMPP control panel.

### For LAMPP (Linux)

1. Open `/opt/lampp/etc/php.ini`.
2. Ensure:

    ```
    extension=pdo_sqlite
    extension=sqlite3
    ```

3. Save and restart Apache:

    ```bash
    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart
    ```

### Verify SQLite is enabled

- Create a `phpinfo.php` file:

    ```php
    <?php phpinfo(); ?>
    ```
- Open in your browser and search for "sqlite" or "PDO drivers". You should see `sqlite3` and `pdo_sqlite` enabled.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HirotakaDango/PHP-Music-Player.git
    cd PHP-Music-Player
    ```

2. **Download getID3:**

    - [Download latest getID3](https://github.com/JamesHeinrich/getID3/releases)
    - Extract as a `getid3` folder inside the project root:
      ```
      PHP-Music-Player/
        index.php
        getid3/
          getid3.php
          ...
      ```

3. **Place music files:**

    - Put your music files in the root folder or any subfolder (except `uploads/`).
    - The player recursively scans for supported audio files.

4. **Set permissions (if needed):**

    - PHP must be able to write to `music.db` in the project directory.
    - For uploads, ensure the `uploads/` folder (auto-created) is writable by PHP.

5. **Run with your favorite PHP server:**

    - Built-in server (for testing):
      ```bash
      php -S localhost:8000
      ```
    - Or use with Apache/Nginx as a standard PHP site.

6. **Open in browser:**

    - Go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
    - Register a user account to unlock uploading and library scanning.
    - **IMPORTANT:** After registering, an admin must verify your account before you can upload music (see below).
    - Click "Scan Library" to index your music folder.

## Usage

- **Register/Login**: Create a user account for full features (upload, scan, delete, edit, favorites, playlists).
- **Account Verification**: After registering, your account must be verified by an admin before you can upload music. Unverified users can still scan, browse, and play music.
- **Scan Library**: Click "Scan Library" in the sidebar to index or refresh your library (scans all music except uploads).
- **Browse**: Use the sidebar to view all songs, favorites, albums, artists, genres, or your own uploads.
- **Playlists**: Create, edit, and drag-to-reorder your own custom playlists. Add/remove songs easily.
- **Search**: Use the search bar (desktop/mobile) to instantly find songs, albums, or artists.
- **Play Music**: Click a song to play, or use the player controls at the bottom.
- **Favorites**: Click the heart icon to add/remove from favorites. Drag to reorder in "Favorites" view.
- **Edit Genre**: Right-click (or tap "..." on mobile) a song and choose "Edit Genre" (your own uploads or as admin).
- **Upload Music**: Click "Upload Song". You can upload multiple files at once; genre is auto-detected but can be overridden. **Upload limit:** 5 songs per user per day (resets at midnight).
- **Delete/Download**: Use context menu on your uploads to delete or download.
- **Share**: Click the "Share" button on albums, artists, playlists, or songs to get a shareable link.
- **PWA**: Click "Install App" (sidebar) if your browser supports PWAs. Works offline for playback and browsing.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Large libraries auto-load more songs as you scroll.
- **Context Menus**: Right-click or tap "..." for per-song actions like share, add to playlist, edit genre, delete, etc.
- **Metadata View**: View song metadata (title, artist, album, genre, year, duration) via context menu.

### Admin Panel

- Go to `?access=admin` (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/?access=admin`)
- Default Admin Password: `admin`
- Admin can verify/un-verify user accounts, view user details, and manage verification status for uploads.
- Admin can also edit/delete any song.

## How does it work?

- **index.php** is both the backend API (`?action=...`) and the single-page frontend.
- User authentication is session-based (server-side PHP sessions).
- User uploads are separated‚Äîeach user can only manage their own uploads.
- Scanning uses getID3 for metadata and album art, storing info in `music.db` (SQLite).
- Album art is extracted, resized, and converted to `.webp`.
- Playback via JavaScript and HTML5 `<audio>`, with Media Session API support.
- PWA support includes manifest and service worker (`?pwa=manifest`, `?pwa=sw`).
- Uploads are stored in `/uploads/{artist}/` and are only accessible to the uploader or admin.
- Only the uploading user (or admin) can edit genre, delete, or download their uploads.
- Playlists and favorites support drag-and-drop ordering.
- Shareable views use query parameters for albums, artists, playlists, or specific songs.

## Customization

- **Colors**: Edit CSS variables in `<style>` inside `index.php`.
- **Audio formats**: Adjust the regex in `scan_music_directory()` in `index.php` to add more formats.
- **Remote sources**: Would require backend refactoring.
- **Public/Internet use**: Add your own authentication and security features (see below).

## Security

- **Warning:** Intended for personal use on your own server or LAN.
- Do **NOT** expose this directly to the public Internet without additional security.
- Each user has their own uploads, favorites, and permissions. Only their own uploads can be deleted/edited/downloaded.
- Users must be verified by an admin before uploading music.
- All write actions and uploads require login and a verified account.
- Admin panel is protected by password.

## Troubleshooting

- **Scan errors**: Ensure `getid3/` exists and is accessible, and PHP can read music files and write `music.db`.
- **Upload errors**: Make sure the `uploads/` directory is writable and PHP settings allow large enough uploads (`upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`). Ensure your account is verified.
- **Missing album art**: Some files may lack embedded images (default SVG will show).
- **Playback issues**: Browser support for some formats (like FLAC) may be limited.
- **Genre not showing**: Use "Edit Genre" from the context menu to update.
