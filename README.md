## How to Activate SQLite in XAMPP/LAMPP

If you are using **XAMPP** or **LAMPP** and encounter issues with SQLite, you may need to enable the SQLite extension:

### For XAMPP (Windows/macOS/Linux)

1. Open your `php.ini` file.  
   - Usually found in `xampp/php/php.ini`.

2. Search for the following lines and ensure they are **not** commented (remove the leading semicolon `;` if present):

    ```
    extension=pdo_sqlite
    extension=sqlite3
    ```

3. Save the `php.ini` file.

4. **Restart Apache** using the XAMPP control panel for changes to take effect.

### For LAMPP (Linux)

1. Open your `php.ini` file located at `/opt/lampp/etc/php.ini`.

2. Find and ensure these lines are enabled (no leading semicolon):

    ```
    extension=pdo_sqlite
    extension=sqlite3
    ```

3. Save the file.

4. Restart Apache:

    ```bash
    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart
    ```

### Verify SQLite is enabled

- Create a `phpinfo.php` file with:
    ```php
    <?php phpinfo(); ?>
    ```
- Open it in your browser and search for "sqlite" or "PDO drivers". You should see `sqlite3` and `pdo_sqlite` enabled.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HirotakaDango/music-player.git
    cd music-player
    ```

2. **Download getID3:**

    - [Download latest getID3](https://github.com/JamesHeinrich/getID3/releases)
    - Extract it as a `getid3` folder inside the project root:
      ```
      music-player/
        index.php
        getid3/
          getid3.php
          ...
      ```

3. **Place music files:**

    - Put your music files in the root folder or any subfolder below (the player recursively scans).

4. **Set permissions (if needed):**

    - The PHP process must be able to write to `music.db` in the project directory.

5. **Run with your favorite PHP server:**

    - Built-in server (for testing):
      ```bash
      php -S localhost:8000
      ```
    - Or use with Apache/Nginx as a normal PHP site.

6. **Open in browser:**

    - Go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
    - Click "Scan Library" to index your music.

## Usage

- **Scan Library**: Click the "Scan Library" button in the sidebar to index or refresh your library.
- **Browse**: Use sidebar to view all songs, favorites, albums, or artists.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to instantly find songs, albums, or artists.
- **Play Music**: Click a song to play, or use the player controls at the bottom.
- **Favorites**: Click the heart icon to add/remove from favorites. Import/export using sidebar.
- **PWA**: Click "Install App" in the sidebar (appears if your browser supports PWAs).

## How does it work?

- **index.php** acts as both the backend API (responding to `?action=...`) and serves the single-page frontend.
- Scanning uses getID3 to extract metadata and album art, storing info in `music.db` (SQLite).
- Album art is extracted, resized, and converted to `.webp` for efficiency.
- All playback is done in-browser via JavaScript and HTML5 `<audio>`.
- PWA features are powered by manifest and a service worker (`?pwa=manifest` and `?pwa=sw`).

## Customization

- To change colors, edit the CSS variables in `<style>` of `index.php`.
- To add more audio formats, adjust the regex in `scan_music_directory()` in `index.php`.
- To support remote music sources, some backend refactoring would be needed.

## Security

- **Warning:** This is intended for personal use on your own server or LAN.
- No authentication or user system is included.
- Do **NOT** expose this directly to the public Internet without additional security.

## Troubleshooting

- **Scan errors**: Ensure `getid3/` exists and is accessible, and PHP has permission to read music files and write `music.db`.
- **Missing album art**: Some files may lack embedded images, default SVG will show.
- **Playback issues**: Browser support for some formats (like FLAC) may be limited.
