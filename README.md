## How to Activate SQLite in XAMPP/LAMPP

If you are using **XAMPP** or **LAMPP** and encounter issues with SQLite, you may need to enable the SQLite extension:

### For XAMPP (Windows/macOS/Linux)

1. Open your `php.ini` file.  
   - Usually found in `xampp/php/php.ini`.

2. Search for the following lines and ensure they are **not** commented (remove the leading semicolon `;` if present):

    ```
    extension=pdo_sqlite
    extension=sqlite3
    ```

3. Save the `php.ini` file.

4. **Restart Apache** using the XAMPP control panel for changes to take effect.

### For LAMPP (Linux)

1. Open your `php.ini` file located at `/opt/lampp/etc/php.ini`.

2. Find and ensure these lines are enabled (no leading semicolon):

    ```
    extension=pdo_sqlite
    extension=sqlite3
    ```

3. Save the file.

4. Restart Apache:

    ```bash
    sudo /opt/lampp/lampp restart
    ```

### Verify SQLite is enabled

- Create a `phpinfo.php` file with:
    ```php
    <?php phpinfo(); ?>
    ```
- Open it in your browser and search for "sqlite" or "PDO drivers". You should see `sqlite3` and `pdo_sqlite` enabled.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/HirotakaDango/music-player.git
    cd music-player
    ```

2. **Download getID3:**

    - [Download latest getID3](https://github.com/JamesHeinrich/getID3/releases)
    - Extract it as a `getid3` folder inside the project root:
      ```
      music-player/
        index.php
        getid3/
          getid3.php
          ...
      ```

3. **Place music files:**

    - Put your music files in the root folder or any subfolder below (the player recursively scans).

4. **Set permissions (if needed):**

    - The PHP process must be able to write to `music.db` in the project directory.
    - For uploads, make sure the `uploads/` folder (auto-created) is writable by PHP.

5. **Run with your favorite PHP server:**

    - Built-in server (for testing):
      ```bash
      php -S localhost:8000
      ```
    - Or use with Apache/Nginx as a normal PHP site.

6. **Open in browser:**

    - Go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
    - Register a user account to unlock uploading and library scanning.
    - Click "Scan Library" to index your music.

## Usage

- **Register/Login**: Create a user account to access full features (upload, scan, delete, edit, favorites).
- **Scan Library**: Click the "Scan Library" button in the sidebar to index or refresh your library (scans all music except uploads).
- **Browse**: Use sidebar to view all songs, favorites, albums, artists, or genres.
- **Search**: Use the search bar to instantly find songs, albums, or artists.
- **Play Music**: Click a song to play, or use the player controls at the bottom.
- **Favorites**: Click the heart icon to add/remove from favorites. Drag to reorder in "Favorites" view.
- **Edit Genre**: Right-click (or tap "..." on mobile) a song and choose "Edit Genre".
- **Upload Music**: Click "Upload Song" in the sidebar. You may upload multiple files; genre is auto-detected but can be overridden.
- **Delete/Download**: Use the context menu on your own uploads to delete or download songs.
- **PWA**: Click "Install App" in the sidebar (appears if your browser supports PWAs).

## How does it work?

- **index.php** acts as both the backend API (responding to `?action=...`) and serves the single-page frontend.
- User authentication is session-based (server-side sessions).
- Scanning uses getID3 to extract metadata and album art, storing info in `music.db` (SQLite).
- Album art is extracted, resized, and converted to `.webp` for efficiency.
- All playback is done in-browser via JavaScript and HTML5 `<audio>`.
- PWA features are powered by a manifest and a service worker (`?pwa=manifest` and `?pwa=sw`).
- Uploads are stored in `/uploads/{artist}/` and only accessible to the uploading user or the admin ("Music Library" user).
- Only the uploading user (or admin) can edit genre, delete, or download their uploads.

## Customization

- To change colors, edit the CSS variables in `<style>` of `index.php`.
- To add more audio formats, adjust the regex in `scan_music_directory()` in `index.php`.
- To support remote music sources, some backend refactoring would be needed.
- For public access, add authentication and security features (see below).

## Security

- **Warning:** This is intended for personal use on your own server or LAN.
- No public authentication or user system is included by default.
- Do **NOT** expose this directly to the public Internet without additional security.
- Each user has their own uploads, favorites, and permissions. Only their own uploads can be deleted/edited/downloaded.

## Troubleshooting

- **Scan errors**: Ensure `getid3/` exists and is accessible, and PHP has permission to read music files and write `music.db`.
- **Upload errors**: Make sure the `uploads/` directory is writeable and that your PHP settings allow large enough file uploads (`upload_max_filesize`, `post_max_size`).
- **Missing album art**: Some files may lack embedded images, default SVG will show.
- **Playback issues**: Browser support for some formats (like FLAC) may be limited.
- **Genre not showing**: Use "Edit Genre" from the context menu to update.
